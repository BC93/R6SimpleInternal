# Project Frost (Public)

This is a base to make internal cheats for the game: Rainbow-Six Siege.

## Usage

Before you ask, no you will not be able to use this without having atleast some knowledge about C++ and Gamehacking in general.
It will compile but it won't do anything useful. You will have to program the features yourself, because this is only a base.

## Authors

* **SMBB** - [My Github](https://github.com/SMBB)

## Caution

This base may be detected by Battleye. I am not responsible for getting you banned.
You have the sourcecode so you should be able to make it undetected. 
Also you won't be able to use this on Battleye protected games without having a proper bypass.
